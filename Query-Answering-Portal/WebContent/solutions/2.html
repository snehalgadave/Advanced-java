 <h1 style="background:yellow;text-align:center;">Features of Java Programming language</h1>


<h2 style="background:pink;text-align:center;">
1.Simple: Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it. <br> <br>

2.Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.<br> <br>

3.Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.<br> <br>

4.Platform Independent: Java is a platform independent programming language.
 It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed.
 Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.<br> <br>

5.Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.<br> <br>

6.Robust: Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.<br> <br>

7.Architecture Neutral: Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.<br> <br>
