<h2 style="background:darkseagreen;text-align:center;">
1.Class(Method) Area: Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field, method data, and the code for methods.<br> <br> <br>

2.Heap: It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects<br> <br>
<br>
3.Stack: Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.<br> <br> <br>
4.program Counter Register: PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.<br> <br> <br>
5.Native Method Stack: It contains all the native methods used in the application.
